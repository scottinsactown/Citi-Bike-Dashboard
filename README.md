## Analysis
The first charts show that ridership steadily increased throughout the second quarter of the year. As the weather  improved, the number of trips increased 20% and trip duration increased 4.5%.

More men than women ride, and female ridership increased slightly from month-to-month. 

The volume of trips per hour tracks with work commute hours, with the most trips in the 5 p.m. hour followed by the 8 a.m. hour.

### Rider Age

In examining the age of riders, there is an unexpected spike at 51 years old, which greatly exceeds the next closest category. Closer examination reveals that this corresponds to riders who claim to be born in 1969. This date has likley been chosen by riders who do not want to share their actual birth year, perhaps because of the crude implication of the number 69.

If birth year 1969 is removed from the analysis, the ridership trends return to what we would expect. Peak rider age is 31.

Trip duration does not greatly vary by age, with an average of 16 minutes per ride. However, the yougest measured groups, 17 year-olds, ride for approximately twice as long as average. This may indicate a more recreational use with potential for targeted promotion.

### Dark Rides

While the majority of rides are during daylight hours, hundreds of thousands ride when dark. The most are in the evening and may represent later work commuters, but ridiing continues through all hours. The same proportion of customers and members ride at night as during the day.

Finally, the most popular stations list contains the same locations as during the day, but in a different order, suggesting different bicycle availability needs.
